A simple Python program that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts with a Student class.

## Features

- Create student objects with name, email, and grades
- Add new grades to existing students
- Calculate average grades automatically
- Store and retrieve students using dictionaries
- Find unique grades across all students
- Convert grades to immutable tuples

## How to Run

```bash
python practice.py
```

## What it does

The program creates three sample students (Joseph, Jackson, and Michael), adds grades to each, and displays their information including calculated averages. It also demonstrates data structures like dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

## Sample Output

The program will display each student's name, email, grades, and average grade, along with all unique grades found across all students.
